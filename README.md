# Slightly Better CraftOS
Small additions to CraftOS to make it more functional.

## Version
This pack targets CC:Tweaked 1.101.3 for Minecraft 1.18.2, though it should work for any 1.18 version and maybe even a few versions above or below.

## Additions
### `speaker` program
Songs will play at volume 2 instead of 1 by default (the range is 0.0 to 3.0). <br/>
The program will now also allow to specify the playback volume using this syntax: `speaker play <file or url> [speaker] [volume]`.
